<body><h1>PNGs in q using libpng</h1>
<p>
  This is meant to be the kind of thing I'd have hoped to find while trawling
  the web for helpful stuff to read, containing nuances of the solution that took
  longer to find than others.
</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
  At the start of my image deblurring university group project, I was tasked with
  blurring some images. An image, at the pixel level, is essentially three matricies
  representing the red, green and blue contributions to the colours of every pixel,
  so q seemed like a clear choice. However, since there was no png library for q
  I had to settle for using <a href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">
  imagemagick</a> and no other image transformation libraries comparable to the
  vast army of libraries available in python using scipy, opencv etc.
</p>
<h2>Libpng</h2>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html">Libpng</a> is a C library
  which acts as the official reference library for PNG images. I chose this
  library to interface into q because it was well supported and the de facto
  standard for png libraries. It is available from the ubuntu package manager
  for download as well, which is handy for build automation.
</p>
<h2>First impressions of Q's C API</h2>
<p>
  I found it was very easy to pick up. The central structure is a K, which as the
  <a href="http://code.kx.com/q/interfaces/capiref/">reference documentation</a>
  will inform you is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union">tagged union</a>,
  which basically means that it encapsulates multiple types as well as some other
  clever stuff which I don't know anything about.
</p>
<p>
  Any function you intend to bind to an actual q session must have return type K
  it must take at least one argument, and all the arguments must have type K. Now
  just because you say K myfunction(K x) {...}, it doesn't mean you can't define
  functions without arguments. The q side of the binding would let you call
  myfunction without arguments and would behave.
</p>
<p>
  Being a writer primarily of elegant, high level programs, my approach to using
  these bindings has been that when I'm writing C, "war is war". Whatever abomination
  comes out the other side has only the requirements of speed and functionality.
  But when you're writing the q side of the binding, everything should be
  <a href="http://www.itiseezee.com/?p=119">100% halal.</a>
</p>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I saw 'cc' in the docs
    <a href="http://code.kx.com/q/interfaces/using-c-functions/">here</a> and it
    worked first time, but I mistyped with gcc or it didn't want to behave or
    something - I don't know. If I don't have to deal with tools' temper tantrums
    then I just dont. I went with cc.</li>
  <li>Your C is to be compiled into a shared library, so you have to specify
    this to the compiler. I'm not sure about this, but I think it is necessary to
    ensure that the compiled object has the .so file extension.</li>
  <li>You must tell the compiler which installed libraries you want the shared
    object to be linked to, otherwise it won't know and your stuff won't work. This
    is done with the -l option, which (at least with cc) must be placed at the end
    of the line. The -l option is then given the name of the library you need to
    link to. If "lib" are the first three characters of your library, omit them.</li>
  <li>After everything is all dandy and works, experiment with the -O family of
    options to improve your code's performance.</li>
  <li>You may need to specify the option -DKXVER=3 unless you include the line
    #define KXVER 3 in your C file before you include k.h. Or something other than
    3 if that's what you're into.</li>
  <li>When q is trying to read from shared objects, it looks in the directory of
    the q executable, so they must end up there to be useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>
   My compile script looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
#!/bin/bash
sharedlibname="$QHOME/l64/$(basename $1 .c).so"
cc -O1 -I. -fPIC -shared -o $sharedlibname $1 -lpng16
exit 0
</code>
</pre>
<p>
  A simple line by line:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Interpret with bash, the default.</li>
  <li>The shared lib should be saved as (in this case) "/home/rob/q/l64/libpngk.so"</li>
  <li>Compile with a few options.</li>
  <li>Get outta there.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Binding</h2>
<p>
  It was pretty easy to get something that worked to be honest. I just did what
  the <a href="http://code.kx.com/q/interfaces/using-c-functions/">docs</a> told
  me to do.
</p>
<p>
  Taken from my git history, here's the first thing I got to behave.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Note that the "five" function is defined to take an argument x, but it's unused. This
    is because of what I mentioned in the "First impressions" section. Your binding
    functions must take at least one argument.
  </li>
  <li>Note also that at this time I was compiling with the -DKXVER=3 option. I don't
    anymore, and so I've put the #define in here and compiled without the flag. Let this
    file be called libpngk.c
  </li>
</ul>
<pre>
<code>
#define KXVER 3
#include "k.h"
#include<png.h> // Just to make sure that this png header is okay.

K five(K x) {
  return ki(5);
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>From here my terminal might look something like:</p>
<pre>
<code>
$rob ./compile-shared-lib.sh libpngk.c # Does the compiling things I specified before.
$rob q64 -q # Not really "-q", but I didn't copy paste this so it's easier this way.
q)five:(`libpngk 2: (`five;1)) // Open up the shared library object and get me the function "five"
q)five[] // Fingers crossed...
5 // Hooray!
q)
</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Once you get the first iteration of something new in, things start moving a lot
  faster. All this compiling and linking stuff, well it's all interesting, but it's
  not all that close to our mission.
</p>
<h2>A first use of libpng</h2>
<p>
  As above regarding the C API, I began by dipping my toe into libpng because I
  just wanted a program whose output I could predict to confirm that I was on the
  right lines. That's science!
</p>
<pre>
<code>
...
K version(K x) {
  return kp(PNG_LIBPNG_VER_STRING);
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
  This does what it says on the tin. Now we can start implementing the functions
  we actually want.
</p>
<h2>K strings vs symbols</h2>
<p>
  In C, strings are null terminated - that is, the last character in a string is
  always a null character - "\0". C inbuilt functions therefore expect char*
  (the equivilant of a string) arguments to be null terminated.
</p>
<p>
  In the q C API, for x of type K, x->s produces the symbol representation of x,
  which is an alias of C*, where C is an alias of char. Another way to get a C*
  from x is to do kC(x), which produces a list of chars from a char list in K.
</p>
<p>
  if "string" is passed to a C API function as x, then:
  x->s is "string\0" NB. Null terminated
  kC(x) is "string" NB. Not null terminated
</p>
<p>
  When we are passing a char* to a C function, we want a null terminated string,
  so we can either use x->s on it's own, or use kC(x) and manually append the
  null terminator. Note that all symbols are
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning">interned</a> and
  retained for the lifetime of the process. For ease of use, I went for using a
  symbol and in the C code I just used x->s.
</p>
<p>
  Checking the validity of a PNG and reading the dimensions was a fairly easy
  cut and paste job from various internet sources, and integrating this into
  q was again a simple case of using the C API docs. They really are quite good.
</p>
<h2>Reading pixels</h2>
<p>
  This is where the docs get insufficient/ambiguous. What I want is some kind of
  matrix representation of the red, green and blue pixel values, similar to what
  I get when I use python's scipy.misc.imread function, which is:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
>>> scpm.imread('images/dustin.png')
array([[[ 14,  13,  14, 255],
        [ 14,  13,  14, 255],
        [ 14,  13,  14, 255],
        ...,
        [ 14,  13,  14, 255],
        [ 14,  13,  14, 255],
        [ 14,  13,  14, 255]],

       [[ 14,  13,  14, 255],
        [ 14,  13,  14, 255],
        [ 14,  13,  14, 255],
        ...
        etc.
</code>
</pre>
<p>
  From various internet sources I managed to produce a way method of iterating
  over the pixels. I won't give all the exact code, it's all in the
  <a href="https://github.com/robknows/qng">repo</a> anyway.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Check that the file is a valid png and open it</li>
  <li>Initialise and populate the png_ptr and info_ptr structs</li>
  <li>Prepare the io operations</li>
  <li>Read the PNG header chunk</li>
  <li>Initialise the row pointers</li>
  <li>Read the image into the row pointers</li>
  <li>You can now iterate over the row pointers</li>
</ol>
<h2>Returning a K</h2>
<p>
  We need to return a K. What exactly we return to users is a design choice I'd
  rather make in the q code, and if performance requirements demand that I make
  it faster, I'll move those choices into the C code. I opted to return a mixed
  list of 3 matrices containing red, green and blue pixel values respectively.
</p>
<p>
  To make a vector in q you can use the ktn(type, length) constructor. Note that
  it is better to predefine the length you require in advance, which provides a
  significant performance boost (Took my aggregated speed results from 160ms to
  100ms). After creating the vector, we can access and assign into it using fields
  of the K struct. In this case we want the byte (G) array, so we do x->G0 to get
  the byte vector of x. We then index into it as appropriate and make the
  assignment. My solution uses three byte vectors, one for each of red, green and
  blue.
</p>
<p>
  On the q side we don't actually want to return bytes, we want numbers between
  0 and 255 - short integers (type "H"). Unfortunately returning shorts directly
  from the C code doesn't work - it gives you jibberish. Hence I convert to short
  integers on the q side of things.
</p>
<h2>Writing pixels</h2>
<p>
  Writing pixels was a fairly simple cut & paste from the internet job after I knew
  how to index into the buffer of pixel values, as per the pixel reading. I assume
  values passed to the C function are short integer vectors. It is necessary to do
  the casting to the correct numeric type before passing to the C function or it
  will produce jibberish/not work.
</p>
<h2>API</h2>
<p>
  I chose to use a dictionary of `r`g`b!(pixel matrices) because it's a fairly
  straightforward model of the image. I also quite like the idea of using a table
  with schema (x, y, r, g, b), but I'm not sure about the performance implications
  of such a design, so I haven't done it yet. After implementing some
  transformations like guassian blur, reflections, negatives etc. I'll do some
  benchmarks comparing the dictionary of matrices vs table of pixels storage
  methods.
