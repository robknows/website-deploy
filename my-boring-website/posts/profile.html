<h2>Work-related summary of me</h2>

<h4>The areas in programming I most enjoy getting right, when I do</h4>

<ul>
<li>Building intuitive, clear, effective APIs at all levels of granularity.  This includes the API exposed by a class in OOP, the API for a RESTful web service, to the API presented by a user application.</li>

<li>Making fully automated whatever ought to be.</li>

<li>Continuous integration.</li>
</ul>

In jobs, I have worked with Java, Javascript, Scala and Q(KDB+). Outside of that I am skilled with Haskell, Python and J. I also have a few months of experience in Rust and Elixir.

<h4>University group projects</h4>

<ul>
<li>Built a compiler in Haskell</li>

<li>Implemented critical features of an operating system (in C)</li>

<li>Wrote a  web app using Python, featuring an android app in Java (before Kotlin was adopted)</li>

<li>Created a program to deblur licence plates using neural networks.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Final year project</h4>

Adaptive compression for graph processing. During scans of a column, the algorithm I built identifies contiguous regions of the column and performs logical compressions. Using the compression information gathered during scans, future queries run faster by reducing the number of values that must be touched during a scan. I built a number of variations using different compression granularities and storage for the gathered column meta-information. I evaluated these algorithms using graph processing algorithms (pagerank, bfs) which perform many queries. The algorithms are just as applicable to relational query optimization as they are too graph query optimization.

Key areas: query optimization, database auto-tuning, graph processing, compression

<h4>Personal projects (Github)</h4>

<ul>
<li>Mixed integer linear programming (MILP) in K using the simplex algorithm, annotated with the same syntax as used in the formal mathematical notation by lecturers.</li>

<li>Genetic algorithms in Q. I'm currently working on a trading program using the library I wrote for GAs and  free historical minute-bar data from the internet.</li>

<li>JSON parser in Haskell. Has an intuitive API and doesn't require you to type down massive models of the structure of the json you're expecting before being able to parse.</li>

<li>Graphing/data visualization in J. Using personal spending data, I created a multitude of line plots, bar charts and pie charts to visualize the areas in which I spent the most money, with a (successful) view to decrease my spending over time.</li>

<li>Multipaxos in Elixir. This was from a piece of university work, I implemented the algorithm, including liveness optimizations, testing multiple backoff techniques, helped greatly by the "paxos.systems" website.</li>

<li>ID3 decision tree algorithm in K. Implemented the algorithm to take a table of discrete data and build decision trees based on the table, and classify new tuples accordingly, using the ID3 algorithm.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Other (sort of relevant?) things I enjoy</h4>

<ul>
<li>Making lists</li>

<li>Filling my calender</li>

<li>Playing sports (Muay Thai is my main sport, but if the opportunity presents itself I'll play all the usuals)</li>

<li>Languages and linguistics (currently learning (daily) French and Georgian, getting my German back up to a high level, thinking about adding Arabic to my daily routine. Did a coursera course on linguistics. NativLang is my favourite youtube channel and you should look at it too!)</li>
</ul>
