<h1>Hello I'm Rob</h1>
<p>This website is neither for the writing of articles,
 nor to impress people with CSS I took from someone else.
 In fact I did it for a reason that is somewhat relatable I hope:
 To have a piece of the internet to call my own.</p>

<p>Writing a little website using q was novel for me and doing the www user
 and blocking against obvious path-traversal things and whatnot was actually
 sort of fun. I bet this is really easy to break though. I can't be bothered
 to think of witty text to fill a target file to place on the system, so
 instead I recommend claiming my nano configuration file as a trophy.</p>
